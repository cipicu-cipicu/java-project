1. Collections Introduction, Interfaces and Implementations

2. Collections Interface Hierarchy
3. Raw Type vs Parameterized Type
4. for-each to loop through arrays and collections
5. Coding Practice

**Exercise 1**  
Use TreeSet to load random strings and check that they are sorted
(System.out.println(TreeSet))

**Exercise 2**
Create a Student class with attributes like "firstName", "lastName", and create an 
"equals" method, and a "compareTo" method that sorts by last name first, then by first name.
Also create a "toString" method in the Student class which displays "Student: " + firstName + " " + lastName

Create an ArrayList, and a HashSet and test that adding Student objects with the same name does not create duplicates in the set but it does in the array.
Create a "TreeSet", which is a sorted set, and print it out same as above. (note: toString is called)

**Exercise 3**  
com.dm.io.StudentsFileParser
 - read data/students.txt
 - (after we discuss Comparator) sort by name
 - sort the enrollments for each student
 - write the sorted data to data/students1.txt
 - create a Set for each class, e.g. `Set<Student> mathClass`, etc.
 - list the students that are enrolled in both Math and Physics?
 - list the students students enrolled in Math that are not enrolled in Physics
 - list the students that are enrolled in both Math and Physics, but are not enrolled in Business
 
### 2. Collections Interface Hierarchy

Collection interface is the top interface
see: Collection, List, Set, Queue  

Differences between the interfaces:

 - List - also called a "sequence", allows duplicates, allows null values, adds get(i), set(i, E)
 - Set - no duplicates (objects have to implement E.equals()), be careful on mutable objects so they don't become equal, no position index (no get(i), set(i))  
 set union: set1.addAll(set2); (note: addAll in List created duplicates, but not in Set) 
 set intersection: set1.retainAll(set2);

On the SortedSet elements implement Comparable interface (e1.compareTo(e2) - remember from Strings)

 - Queue - FIFO (elements sorted by order they were added to the Queue) - offer(), poll(), peek(); has a concept of "head" and "tail" - you add (offer) to "tail", and poll from "head"

Some objects implement multiple interfaces (for example LinkedList: both List and Queue)

### 3. Parameterized Type

```
ArrayList<String> myStringList = new ArrayList<String>();
ArrayList<Student> myStudentList = new ArrayList<Student>();
```

### 4. for-each

```
Iterator<Student> it = treeSet.iterator();
while (it.hasNext()) {
  System.out.println(it.next());
}
		
		
for (String element: myStringList) {
}

for (Student element: myStudentList) {
}
```
