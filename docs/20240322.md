com.dm.io.StudentsFileParser
 - read data/students.txt
 - (after we discuss Comparator) sort by name
 - sort the enrollments for each student
 - write the sorted data to data/students1.txt
 - create a Set for each class, e.g. Set<Student> mathClass, etc.
 - list the students that are enrolled in both Math and Physics?
 - list the students students enrolled in Math that are not enrolled in Physics
 - list the students that are enrolled in both Math and Physics, but are not enrolled in Business
