## Exception Handling

When running Java applications, errors can occur. The technical term for when this
happens is that Java will "throw an exception".  

In your application code you can either "catch" the exception, or let it flow up to
the calling process.

There are two types of exceptions:
 - checked exceptions (you must add code for these, either catch, or throw to the calling process)
 - unchecked exceptions (you are not forced to add any code for these)
 
Checked exceptions are identified at compile time (your code will have errors if you don't handle them,
by either re-throwing them, or surrounding the code with a try-catch block)).
These extend the "Exception" class (or one of its children classes).
Example: FileNotFoundException (thrown by FileInputStream)

Unchecked exceptions are *not* identified at compile time, are only caught at runtime (i.e. when running
the application).
These extend "RuntimeException" or "Error" (and their children)

A try-catch block would look like below:

```
try {
   ... code to run that throws exception
} catch (Exception e) {
   ... what to do in case an exception occurs
}
```

.
